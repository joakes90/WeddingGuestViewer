# Wedding guest viewer

This project is a companion to the Wedding web site project.
Its aim is to display all the guests who have RSVPed and are stored in the Firebase Firestore.

This app is very minimal and for personal use. If you would like to use it for a jumping off point it does demonstrate diffable datasource tableviews, applying sorting in these views, and creating a no storyboard based UIKit app runtime for both iOS and iPadOS
